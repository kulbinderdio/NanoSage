# NanoSage Product Context

## Purpose & Vision
NanoSage addresses the growing need for sophisticated research tools that can operate independently of cloud services while maintaining high-quality output. It empowers users to conduct deep, structured research using their local computing resources.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Research Depth vs. Resource Constraints
- **Problem**: Deep research typically requires significant computational resources or expensive API access
- **Solution**: Uses small, efficient models locally while maintaining quality through intelligent search strategies

### 2. Search Organization & Relevance
- **Problem**: Research often leads to scattered, unfocused results
- **Solution**: Implements a recursive, relevance-driven pipeline that maintains context and builds structured knowledge

### 3. Local Computing Limitations
- **Problem**: Most advanced research tools require cloud resources or powerful hardware
- **Solution**: Optimized for laptop deployment using small models and efficient processing

### 4. Research Documentation
- **Problem**: Difficulty in organizing and presenting research findings coherently
- **Solution**: Automated generation of well-structured markdown reports with clear TOC

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Simplicity
